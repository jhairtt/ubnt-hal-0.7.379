Madwifi (Atheros) binary-compatible HAL for Ubiquiti Networks cards
===================================================================

Version 0.7-beta.379 (2008-04-17)
---------------------------------
 - fixed the following patches for 2.6.24 and up
   - 030-chanwidth-ccode.patch
   - 073-dynack.patch
   - 300-napi_polling.patch

Version 0.7-beta.377 (2008-04-16)
---------------------------------
 - fixed TX power setting into hardware
 - fixed VLAN WMM classification issue
 - fixed frequency translation issues for XR9,XR3 products
 - fixed AP scan module to work properly with half/quarter rates
 - updated openwrt patches which did not apply cleanly
 - macclone patch now supports 2.6.24 kernel properly
 - added licensed frequency support (you have to get license from ubnt)
 - extended Mikrotik IE support - only use it when AP/clients have it enabled

Version 0.6-beta.280 (2008-03-05)
---------------------------------
 - moved to madwifi-dfs-r3319-20080201 snapshot
 - even though we moved to madwifi DFS branch, DFS is still disabled!
 - added frequency translation, so that special frequencies (like 900Mhz)
   would be reported "as is" to the userspace applications
 - ported the following features from LiteStation products:
   - dynamic ACK (aka AutoACK)
   - report RX Rate of the last received data packet
   - CCQ (client connection quality) reporting
   - rudimentary Mikrotik IE inclusion
   - MAC cloning support (suitable for single MAC bridging solutions)

Version 0.5-beta.226 (unreleased to public)
------------------------------------------
 - still disabled DFS
 - fixed xscale-be-elf hw-reset failures
 - added x86_64-elf builds
 - added tx power translation inside the HAL
 - implemented autodetection for cards:
   - XR3-2.8
   - XR3
   - XR3-3.6
   - XR2.3

Version 0.4-alpha.179 (2007-12-7)
---------------------------------
 - disabled DFS/radar support for 5Ghz cards temporarily, as it was causing
 random crashes
 - fixed mips2-le build (tested on rb532a board)
 - fixed SR9/XR9 frequency mappings (with autodetection)
 - improved power limit handling according to calibration data (XR5 now 
 allows 18 dBm setting as it is supposed to)
 - implemented card autodetection - the following cards will no longer need
 manual country code changes to work as expected:
   - SR9/XR9
   - XR7
   - XR2.3
   - SR4/SR4C

Version 0.3-alpha.139
----------------------
 - moved to 0.9.30.13 binary-compatible HAL version, which means we've
 dropped support for 0.9.3.x in favor of madwifi-ng-r2568-20070710 snapshot
 - added more architecture builds:
    - xscale-be/le, but only xscale-be tested)
    - mips2-be/le (untested!)
    - mipsisa32-be/le (untested!)
    - powerPC (untested!)
 - basic tests (mostly x86) done for the following Ubiquiti cards:
    - SR2/XR2
    - SR5/XR5
    - SR9/XR9
